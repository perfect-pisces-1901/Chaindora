# Chaindora

## Overview

Chaindora is a music streaming service that benefits creators
by storing track ownership and streaming revenue payout arrangements
in a smart contract on the Etherium blockchain.

Chaindora works as a conventional streaming service for listeners
(who can pay by track or by subscription). For creators, it hosts
tracks on IPFS, saves a file hash and creator id on the blockchain[1]
with a smart contract governing playback revenue payout.

[1] This is an oversimplified approach that does not really protect
against capturing the stream and making trivial content modifications
to bypass the hash. This project is just a sketch-of-concept!
